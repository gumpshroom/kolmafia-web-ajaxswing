In this folder you see links to Java applications: WindowsThemeDemo and SwingSet which is part of the Sun Java JDK. You might want to run these Java applications and compare them with AjaxSwing outputs.

We highly recommend to start the SwingSet from here along with web-enabled version SwingSet from your browser:
http://localhost:8040/ajaxswing/apps/SwingSet

This is the best way to compare tab by tab Sun SwingSet and SwingSet web-enabled by AjaxSwing.
